# The-Android-App-Market-on-Google-Play

## Conducting a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. We'll look for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.

- Explored which category has the highest share of (active) apps in the market, if any specific category is dominating the market, and which categories have the fewest number of apps
- Made effective approach to come up with strategies to size and price our app by studying: the effect of the size of an app on its rating; users' perception about system-heavy apps vs. light-weighted apps; the effect of price of an app on its rating; users changes in preference when it comes to free vs. paid apps
- Explored relation between app category and app price by looking at how companies and developers are supposed to make ends meet; what monetization strategies companies can use to maximize profit; and what costs of apps are largely based on features, complexity, and platform
- Conducted sentiment analysis by plotting sentiment polarity scores of user reviews for paid and free apps
